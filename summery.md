# Summery

I’m a creator, a competitor, and a curious kid who loves bringing ideas to life, whether it’s through code, robots, or crafts. On the basketball court, I’m all about teamwork and hustle, and in ninja class, I’m flipping and moving with confidence. My passion for tech drives me to explore computers and build games that spark joy, while my love for building and sports keeps me active and inspired. Whether I’m designing a new game, shooting hoops, or mastering a front flip, I’m always learning, growing, and having fun. If you want to talk about games, robots, basketball, or being a ninja, I’m your guy—ready to share my excitement and maybe even team up for the next big adventure!
